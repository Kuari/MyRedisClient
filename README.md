## Info

`RedFish` is a convenient, cross-platform, data-focused Redis GUI client. I added some (think) fantastic ideas as much as I could, like right-clicking to zoom in on the data and editable features, and taking advice from more senior developers to improve it. Since `Beta 1.0.0`, after several months of intermittent development, many areas have been optimized, and even some functions include different processing methods, which can adapt to different operating habits, hoping to bring a better experience. Thanks to every user, if you have any feedback, I hope you can let me know.
